# 2. Guiding Principles

## Manifesto

The guiding principles that define the core philosophy of the Naamio Foundation, its projects, efforts, community work, and artifscts, are as follows:

 - people should have full control over their data and communications;
 - people should not be locked into centralised data or communication silos, but instead be free to locate their data, services, and communications where they see fit, without limiting their ability to integrate additional services through federation;
 - the ability to read, update, move, and delete their data, and to communicate, securely and privately is a basic human right;
 - data and communication federation and control should be available to everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard, and global network.

These principles are enshrined in the Foundation's Objectives.

## Mission

The Foundation exists to act as a neutral custodian for Naamio protocols, technologies, and infrastructure, and to nurture them as efficiently as possible as a set of unfragmented artifacts, for the greater benefit of the whole ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any single entity or subset of entities.

## Values
 
The Foundation's values are as follows:

 - supporting the whole long-term ecosystem rather than individual stakeholder gain;
 - openness rather than properietary lock-in;
 - interoperability rather than fragmentation;
 - cross-platform rather than platform-specific;
 - cross-vender rather than vendor-specific;
 - collaboration rather than competition;
 - accessibility and inclusivity rather than elitism;
 - transparency rather than stealth and secrecy;
 - empathy rather than contrariness;
 - pragmatism rather than perfection;
 - proof rather than conjecture.

For these reasons patent encumbered intellectual property (IP) is strictly prohibited from being added to protocols, standards, software, hardware, or other artifacts, as is making said items rely on non-standard / unspecified behavior of other systems or actors.
