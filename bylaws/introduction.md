# Introduction

## 1. Preamble

The Naamio Foundation (the "Foundation") is a cooperative (osuuskunta) company established with the Finnish Patent and Registration office (PRH) under Finnish law.

Naamio was originally concieved of as a subsidiary of Omnijar OÜ in 2018 and has been developed and incubated within Omnijar OÜ (Estonia company number 14661277). To safeguard the neutrality of Naamio and allow for further independent development, Naamio has been spun out into the Foundation, with assets necessary for the project transferred to the Foundation.

As a cooperative company, the Foundation's governing document is its Articles of Association ("Articles"), a legal document which sets out what the Foundation, as a osuuskunta and a company, can do in pursuit of the Objectives for which it was established, namely to:

> "empower individuals to control their data, and have freedom over such data, and related infrastructure, by creating, maintaining, and promoting openly standardised, secure, decentralized and distributed protocols, software, hardware, and networks, open to all, and available to the public for no charge; and build and develop an appropriate governance model for Naamio artifacts and projects through the Foundation, in order to drive the adoption of Naamio protocols, and complementary open protocols, as loosely interconnected and federated standards, unemcumbered from any properietary intellectual property and / or technological patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging experimentation), maximising speed of development, and prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall protocols over the commercial concerns of an individual person or persons."

The Objectives, and any other change to the Articles, may only be amended with approval of at least 80% of the Foundation's members, who for the purpose of company law are also the Foundation's Guardians (explained further below).

These Rules govern the day-to-day operations of the Foundation in more detail than can be deal with in the Articles.

In the event of a conflict between these Rules and the Articles, the Articles shall prevail, unless subject to a Special Resolution.
