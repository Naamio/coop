# The Guardians

The Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation for the purposes of company law. Acting collectively the Guardians are the Foundation’s board of directors (the “Board”).

The Guardians are responsible for the orchestration of the Foundation’s operations, setting the strategic direction of the Foundation, and monitoring performance against the Foundation’s objectives, principles, and its strategy. This includes ensuring that the Foundation keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of standards, protocols, software, and hardware that aligns to the Naamio mission.

Furthermore, the Guardians are responsible for maintaining and updating the [Guiding Principles](./principles.md). Any amendment to the Guiding Principles shall require a Special Resolution of the Board.

The Guardians shall consist of not less than two and not more than twelve Guardians. The Foundation was incorporated with two founder Guardians, P J Łaszkowicz and Stefano Mosconi. The Founder Guardians shall be joined by additional Guardians (with the Founder Guardians forming a minority of the Board) to ensure there is continuity. 

The Guardians are self-appointing meaning that the Guardians currently in post may appoint any individuals eligible to hold the role, either to fill a vacancy or to act as an additional Guardian. However, any Guardian appointed must be respected and trusted by the wider Naamio community to uphold the Guiding Principles and keep the other Guardians honest.

The Guardians are required to act with integrity and transparency. All Guardian decisions (including all Board resolutions) should be openly published and available to the public.

## Delegation by the Guardians

The Guardians, in exercising the powers of the Foundation, also have the ability to delegate responsibility for such functions and activities as they see fit. 

## Summary of Guardian Responsibilities

The Guardians must keep each other honest, providing a ‘checks and balances’ mechanism between each other to ensure that all Guardians act in the best interests of the protocols, projects, software, hardware, artifacts, and ecosystem.

The Guardians may dismiss members who are in serious breach of the Guiding Principles.

The Guardians are responsible for approving use of the Foundation's assets (e.g. redistributing donations).

The Guardians shall also be responsible for hiring staff to support the administrative functions and other roles required to facilitate the Foundation's mission.

They may also oversee committees for specific areas such as marketing, or registering custom event types.

The Guardians are responsible for choosing if, when and how staff are appointed by the Foundation to fill administrative and other functions required to facilitate the Foundation’s mission.

The Guardians are responsible for choosing if and when committees are formed, and to oversee those committees.

Not all Guardians are required to be involved on a day-to-day basis; however those not taking a “hands-on” approach are required to monitor to ensure a suitable balance is kept by those that do.
