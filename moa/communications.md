# Communications

All notices (except notices of meetings given to the Guardians) shall be in Writing.

Notices and other documents to be served on Members or Guardians under the Articles or legally may be served:

1. By suitable Electronic Means provided the Foundation has complied with regulatory requirements in relation to the service of such notices.

Any notice given in accordance with these Articles is to be treated for all purposes as having been received:

1. 24 hours after being sent by Electronic Means;

2. As soon as the recipient acknowledges actual receipt.

A technical defect in service of which the Guardians are unaware at the time does not invalidate decisions taken at a meeting.

Documents and notices may be sent to the Foundation by Electronic Means to the address specified by the Foundation for that purpose and such documents and notices sent to the Foundation are sufficiently authenticated if the identity of the sender is confirmed in the way the Foundation has specified.
