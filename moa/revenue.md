# Revenue and Property

The income and property of the Foundation from wherever derived shall be applied solely in promoting the Foundationâ€™s Objectives.

## Membership Shared Revenue

The Foundation will decide regularly (no more than every 12-months) at a special meeting whether to distribute revenue to Members and what percentage of revenue to distribute under the Membership Shared Revenue pool.

Such distribution is undertaken as remuneration for efforts to support the Foundation and the Rules will determine how the distribution is made, unless the special meeting appends an alteration to those rules for the current payment period.

The scheduling for the payment distribution will be determined in the special meeting.

No payment distribution shall be permitted if it:

1. places the Foundation in financial jeapordy; or

2. exceeds the post-tax profit for the latest fiscal period.

Guardians will not receive separate funding pool beyond the Membership Shared Revenue.

## Special Payments

Nothing in these Articles shall prevent any payment in good faith by the Foundation of:
 
1. reasonable and proper remuneration to any Member, Guardian, other officer or servant of the Foundation, or any Connected Person, for any services rendered to the Foundation;

2. any interest on money lent by any Member, any Guardian or any Connected Person at a reasonable and proper rate; or

3. reasonable and proper rent for premises demised or let by any Member or Guardian.

## Sponsorship

Sponsorship will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Members as long as:

1. the sponsor has not taken actions known by the Foundation to be in constrast to the [Objectives](./objectives.md) or [Principles](../bylaws/principles.md) of the Foundation in the past 12-months.

2. the sponsor has not made statements known by the Foundation to be in constrast to the [Objectives](./objectives.md) or [Principles](../bylaws/principles.md) of the Foundation in the past 12-months.

3. the sponsor has no investments known by the Foundation to be in constrast to the [Objectives](./objectives.md) or [Principles](../bylaws/principles.md) of the Foundation in the past 12-months.

4. the sponsor has no products or services known by the Foundation to be in constrast to the [Objectives](./objectives.md) or [Principles](../bylaws/principles.md) of the Foundation in the past 12-months.

The aim of these rules is to ensure that financial viability is not gained from entities not aligned with the Foundation's [Objectives](./objectives.md) and [Principles](../bylaws/principles.md) and therefore does not malign the Foundation's own efforts or have the potential to sway the Foundation's efforts.

The period of 12-months is to provide for the ability for an entity to alter their actions with the understanding that any such change by an entity would be significant over such a period and therefore prohibitive as an effort for a shallow gesture.
