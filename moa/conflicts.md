# Conflicts

The property and funds of the Foundation must be used for promoting the Objectives.

The Guardians may, in accordance with the requirements set out in this article, authorise any Conflict proposed to them by any Guardian which would, if not authorised, involve a Guardian (an "Interested Guardian") breaching their duty to avoid conflicts of interest.

Alternatively, any Conflict may be authoorised by a Special Resolution of the Members.

Any authorisation by Guardians shall be effective, only if:

1. to the extent permitted, the matter in question shall have been proposed by any Guardian for the consideration in the same way that other matter may be proposed to the Guardians under the provisions of these Articles or in such other manner as the Guardians may determine;

2. any requirement as to the quorum for consideration of the relevant matter is met without counting the Interested Guardian; and

3. the matter was agreed to without the Interested Guardian voting or would have been agreed to if the Interested Guardian's vote had not been counted.

Any authorisation of a Conflict (whether at the time of giving the authorisation or subsequently)may:

1. extend to any actual or potential conflict of interest which may reasonably be expected to arise out of the matter or situation so authorised;

2. provide that the Interested Guardian be excluded from the receipt of documents and information and the participation in discussions (whether at meetings of the Guardians or otherwise) related to the Conflict.

3. provide that the Interested Guardian shall or shall not be eligable to vote ein respect of any future decision of the Guardians in relation to any resolution related to the Conflict;

4. impose upon the Interested Guardian such other terms fo the purposes of dealing with the Conflict as the Guardians see fit;

5. provide that, where the Interested Guardian obtains, or has obtained (through his involvement in the Conflict and otherwiase than through his position as a Guardian of the Foundation) information that is confidential to a third-party, they shall not be obliged to disclose that information to the Foundation, or to use it in relation to the Foundation's affairs where to do so would amount to a breach of that confidence; and

6. permit the Interested Guardian to absent themself from the discussion of matters relating to the Conflict at any meeting of the Guardians and be excused from reviewing papers prepared by, or for, the Guardians to the extent they relate to such matters.

Where the Guardians or Members authorise a Conflict, the Interested Guardian shall be obliged to conduct themself in accordance with any terms and conditions imposed by the Guardians or Members in relation to the Conflict.

The Guardians or Members, as the case may be, may revoke or vary an authorisation they have given at any time, but this shall not affect anything done by the Interested Guardian prior to such revocation or variation in accordance with the terms of such authorisation.

A Guardian is not required, by reason of being a Guardian (or because of the fiduciary relationship established by reason of being a Guardian), to account to the Foundation for any remuneration, profit or other benefit which they derive from or in connection with a relationship involving a Conflict which has been authorised by the Guardians in accordance with these Articles or by the Foundation in general meeting (subject in each case to any terms, limits or conditions attaching to that authorisation) and no contract shall be liable to be avoided on such grounds.
