# The Guardians

Subject to the provisions, these Articles, the Rules, and to any directions given by any Special Resolution of the Members, the operations of the Foundation shall be overseen by the Guardians. However no resolution passed by the Foundation in a general meeting shall invalidate any prior act of the Guardians which would have been valid if that resolution had not been passed.

## The Number of Guardians

The minimum number of Guardians shall be two and the maximum number shall be twelve.

## Appointment and Retirement of Guardians

The Guardians shall appoint any individual who is eligible as a Guardian to fill a vacancy or (subject to the maximum number permitted in the Articles) as an additional Guardian, subject to any requirements set out in the Rules from time to time, and provided at least 80% of the current Guardians approve the appointment.

The Rules will determine appointment requirements, including any nominal annual fees (similar but separate to [Membership](./membership.md) fees) and conflicting commitments (in respect to principles of the Foundation). 

A Guardian may not act as a Guardian unless they:

1. are admitted as a Member;

2. signs a Written declaration of willingness to be a Guardian of the Foundation;

3. is over 16; and

4. is not disqualified from acting as a company director.

A Guardian may retire by giving written notice to the Foundation, and such resignation takes effect in accordance with its terms, save that a Guardianâ€™s notice of resignation will not take effect if, after their resignation, there would then be fewer than the minimum number of Guardians as set out in the Articles.

A technical defect in the appointment of a Guardian of which the Guardians are unaware at the time does not invalidate decisions taken at a meeting of the Guardians.

Any Guardian fees submitted will be retained by the Foundation regardless of the reasons for a Guardian being removed from the Board.

## Disqualification and Removal of Guardians

A Guardian's term of office as such automatically terminates if they:

1. are disqualified under the Finnish or European law from acting as a director of the Foundation;

2. are incapable, whether mentally or physically of managing their own affairs;

3. are absent without notice from three consecutive meetings of the Guardians and is removed from office by a majority decision of the other Guardians;

4. have a bankruptcy order made against him/her;

5. are removed by the Members at a General Meeting;

6. are removed by a resolution approved by at least 80% of the Guardians on the grounds that they are guilty of conduct detrimental to, or of acting in any way that may undermine, the Objectives, the Guiding Principles, or the reputation of the Foundation; or

7. ceases to be a Member of the Foundation.
